is used in all recons (reconciliations) of BP2S (BNP Paribas Securities Services), and you're asking how it ties into APS (Automated Processing Systems), here's a clear breakdown of:

Problems Solved by the Code

1. Automated File Arrival Verification

Problem: Manual checking of whether expected files have arrived on time in APS job chains is error-prone.

Solution: The script automatically monitors directories and verifies whether:

At least one file (fm mode), or

A specific number of files (cfm mode) have arrived within a defined time window.




---

2. Time-Bound Monitoring

Problem: APS jobs need to wait for files but cannot afford indefinite delays.

Solution: The run_time parameter ensures monitoring ends within a strict duration. If files don’t arrive on time, it logs failure and exits.



---

3. Validation of Expected Files

Problem: Missing or extra files can cause reconciliation mismatches.

Solution: The cfm mode ensures exact match with expected file counts, preventing over/under-processing.



---

4. Centralized Logging

Problem: It’s hard to trace file arrivals in a complex APS environment with many dependencies.

Solution: The logging system writes detailed logs to a file (and console), including:

Timestamp

File pattern

Matching file names

Arrival times

PASS/FAIL status




---

5. Directory Structure Awareness

Problem: APS can crash or raise alerts if monitored directories don’t exist.

Solution: The script checks if the directory exists before monitoring, logs if it's missing, and exits gracefully (no crash).

Usefulness in APS Context

Use Case in APS	How the Script Helps

File-based Triggers	Ensures APS can trigger downstream jobs only after correct files are detected.
Job Dependency Control	Avoids false triggers by validating file presence/count.
Night Batch Monitoring	Ensures all EOD (End-of-Day) files are received and processed timely.
Audit & Compliance	Keeps audit trail with timestamped logs for SLA enforcement and compliance reports.
Error Reporting	Logs “FAILURE” when files are missing or counts mismatch, which APS can parse and alert on.
Restart Handling	If APS re-runs a failed job, the script avoids processing already-arrived files again, using timestamps.

Summary

This script automates and standardizes file monitoring, which is critical for APS-based reconciliation workflows in BP2S. It reduces manual errors, ensures job dependencies are respected, and supports better reporting and auditing — making reconciliation faster, more reliable, and traceable.
