Objective:

You are building a file monitoring utility that can:

1. Check for file presence in a given directory that matches a pattern.


2. Support two modes:

fm (File Monitor): Check if at least one matching file has arrived within a given time window.

cfm (Count File Monitor): Check if an exact number of files have arrived within the time window.



3. Log the entire monitoring process in a detailed log file, with timestamps and statuses.


4. Optionally generate Excel summaries of file statuses (although the implementation of this part seems incomplete).


5. Handle command-line arguments and validate them thoroughly before starting the monitoring process.




---

Inputs via CLI:

You expect users to provide arguments like:

file_pattern_path: pattern like C:/data/*.txt

--time_interval: how recent the file creation time must be (in minutes)

--run_time: how long to run the monitoring loop

--mode: either fm or cfm

--accepted_file_count: only required for cfm mode

--log_file_path: where the log should be saved



---

Functional Behavior:

In fm mode, the script:

Monitors the specified directory for any files matching the pattern.

Logs the creation time of found files.

Exits early if any file is found.


In cfm mode, the script:

Monitors for an exact number of files within the time interval.

Logs each file and checks if the number of files equals accepted_file_count.

Exits early if the count matches.




---

Other Features:

Uses a custom dual-output logger that logs both to the console and to a file.

Has validation checks for all required arguments.

Gracefully handles missing directories or pattern mismatches.

Attempts to provide readable logging output with timestamps.



---

Issues Noted:

There are many syntax and formatting problems in the code:

Typos like Import, isport, definit, setup logger, If instead of if, etc.

Incorrect or malformed function names: write excel_summary, count_file_monitor, etc.

Misplaced parentheses and string formatting issues.

Missing or incorrect use of colons (:), indentation, and brackets.



---

Conclusion:

This script is meant to monitor file arrival in real-time, ensure compliance with expected patterns or counts, log the activity, and possibly generate reports. However, it needs cleaning up and debugging to be runnable and maintainable.
